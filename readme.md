Opensource thirdparty components
================================

This repository contains several opensource components that I'm using.
Compared to the originals they have been changed to my needs and where
needed bugs have been fixed.
Other bug fixes, comments and patches with new features are welcome.
However be aware that this is a hobby project of mine and at home I'm
still using Delphi 6. To be accepted all patches need to be compatible
with Delphi 6.

Overview of components
----------------------

1. graphicex
------------
This is the latest version of graphicex that I could find with all
bugfixes that I found online applied and several others fixed by me.
Besides that some minor changes to the code have been me.
The .obj files needed for jpg and tif support are available as a
separate download since versioning them in hg doesn't work well.

adapted to my needs.
